Result 1 was obtained from the following concentrations:
Nsub-1e18, Nnw-2e16, Nch-4e17.

Result 2 was obtained from the following concentrations:
Nsub-1e18 Nnw-1e16 Nch-4e17.

Result 3 was obtained from the following concentrations:
Nsub-1e18 Nnw-1e16 Nch-8e16.

Result 4 was obtained from the following concentrations:
Nsub-1e18 Nnw-1e16 Nch-1e17.

where 'Nsub' is the doping concentration of substrate, 'Nnw' is the doping concentration of drift region, 'Nch' is the doping concentration of channel formed.

From this results we can interpret that for a specific doping concentration of all the three are the deciding factor for the higher breakdown region, currently we achieved a breakdown voltage of 200V which can be observed from Result 4.
