# LDMOS

LDMOS is a variation of the very invaluable MOSFET with an improved design to handle higher breakdown voltages 

The capstone project aims to build a power amplifier using LDMOS with a GaN base, which was chosen due to its superior properties like wide-bandgap and high heat capacity and thermal conductivity
